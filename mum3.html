<h2>Summary of My experience and portrofilo:</h2>
<p>
<h3><p>The project I was involved in  was a redesign of a smart home control system to improve its usability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal.
<br> The original system had a complex interface and lacked intuitive controls, leading to frustration for users.
<br> The goal was to create a streamlined and visually pleasing user experience while maintaining seamless integration with existing smart devices.
<br> The design process involved user research, user-centred design, information architecture restructure, wireframing and prototyping, and visual design.
<br> The redesigned system offered homeowners an intuitive interface with clear controls for lighting, HVAC, security, and entertainment systems. 
<br>The visual design conveyed a sense of simplicity and elegance, seamlessly integrating with the home's interior design.
<br>The project resulted in increased user satisfaction, reduced frustration, and improved efficiency in controlling and monitoring home systems. 
<br>Homeowners appreciated the streamlined interface and found it easy to customize settings, create automation routines, and monitor energy usage.
<br> This project showcased the team's expertise in user-centred design, information architecture, wireframing, prototyping, visual design, and usability testing.
<br>Another project I was involved in was designing an interactive educational software interface for elementary school students.
<br> The goal was to create a visually appealing and engaging interface that would encourage participation and enhance their learning experience. 
<br>The design approach involved a vibrant color palette, custom illustrations, clear typography, a clean and intuitive layout, visual feedback, gamification elements, and responsive design.

<br>The color palette was chosen to evoke fun and excitement while maintaining visual harmony.
 <br>Custom illustrations and icons were used to make the interface relatable to young students, creating a sense of familiarity and engagement.
 <br>A clear and legible typeface was selected for young readers, with font variations such as bold and italic emphasized.

<br>The interface was organized using a grid-based structure, with clear visual cues like buttons and arrows.
 <br>Visual feedback was provided through interactive buttons that changed color or displayed animated effects upon clicking.
 <br>Gamification elements were integrated to track students' achievements and provide a sense of accomplishment.

<br>The interface was responsive and adaptable across various screen sizes, ensuring visual appeal and usability on different devices. 
<br>The project exemplifies how visual appeal and design principles can be applied to create an interactive educational interface that captivates and inspires young learners.
