<h2>Summary of My Personal Story:</h2>
<p>
<h3><p>My journey as a computer and industrial design engineer began with a childhood fascination for both technology and aesthetics.

<br>I wanted to create physical products that seamlessly integrated technology and design, products that not only functioned flawlessly but also appealed to users on an aesthetic and emotional level.

<br>I pursued a dual degree in computer science and industrial design, immersing myself in courses that ranged from human-centered design to electronics and hardware prototyping.

<br>I'm excited to embark on new projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of computer and industrial design engineering.
